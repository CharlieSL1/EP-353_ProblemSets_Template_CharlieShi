Simple Synthesizer Using Raspberry Pi and GPIO Control

_**What have you done for your project so far?**_

I have successfully set up the Raspberry Pi environment, connected an amplifier and speaker system, and used the wiringPi library to generate and send audio signals through the GPIO pins. The basic sound generation and playback through the amplifier and speaker have been implemented.

**What have you not done for your project yet?**

I have not completed the functionality for switching sound modes or controlling sound parameters via the physical switch button. Also, I have not fully tested the stability of the system during extended operation.

**What problems, if any, have you encountered?**

The main problem I have encountered is that the switch button is not working as expected. Pressing the button does not trigger the intended switching or control behavior in the synthesizer program. I suspect the issue might be related to GPIO input reading, software debouncing, or incorrect pin configuration.
